title: "Example 2"
excerpt: "This is a map I made in Qgis depicting trails and waterfalls in Smokey Mountain National Park. As apart of this lab I made an interactive version of this map in RStudio. I aquired the park data from the national parks arcgis geodatabase. I downloaded a park outline, trailmap, and some interesting points of intrest to be mapped out. The data to make this map in qgis was exported as a geopackage file from RStudio. <br/><img src='/images/2ndfile.png'>"

title: "Example 1"
excerpt: "This is a map I made in Rstudio depicting the poverty rate by census tract in Maryland. It uses data from ACS 5 year estimates between 2018 and 2022. The code was fairly simple, after pulling census data the poverty v% was created by dividing poverty count by total population and multiplying by 100. <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"

This website has a bit of the GIScience and Remote Sensing work I have done in my time as an undergrad at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. 

As my bio says I am an Environmental Science and Geography B.S. major and also pursuing a GIS certificate. I enjoy making these maps in my classes and hope to inocorporate that intrest someway into my future postgraduation.
